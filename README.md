In this repo, I will be sharing my computer networking labs and projects implemented on packet tracer  :

currently there are 
* one project about vlans , it is the implementation of CCNA module 2 chapter 6  . 
* one lab about data link layer particalarly ARP request  

Every lab/project has three  files :  
* Requirement file 
* Report indcates steps and question answering 
* Packet tracer implementation

A very helpful resource on implementing vlans , nativve lans , and trunks is these video series :
